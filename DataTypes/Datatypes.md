## Java Data Types:
1. Whole Number Data Types:

     - byte: 8-bit integer, range from -128 to 127. Useful for saving memory in large arrays.
     - short: 16-bit integer, range from -32,768 to 32,767.
     - int: 32-bit integer, range from -2^31 to 2^31 - 1. This is the default data type for integers.
     - long: 64-bit integer, range from -2^63 to 2^63 - 1. Used when a wider range is needed.
2. Decimal Number Data Types:

     - float: 32-bit floating-point number, with a range of approximately 1.4E-45 to 3.4028235E38.
     - double: 64-bit floating-point number, with a range of approximately 4.9E-324 to 1. to 7976931348623157E308. This is the default data type for decimal values.
2. Boolean Data Type:

     - boolean: Can only take two possible values: true or false.
3. Character & String Data Types:
     
     - char: 16-bit Unicode character that can store a single character, e.g., 'a', '1', or '@'.
     - String: Not a primitive type but widely used. It represents a sequence of characters (e.g., "Hello").
4. Data Type Ranges:

     - The ranges for each type are determined by their bit size (e.g., byte is 8 bits, int is 32 bits).
     - These ranges define the minimum and maximum values that each data type can hold.
