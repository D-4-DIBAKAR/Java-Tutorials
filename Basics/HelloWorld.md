## Key Points:
1. Class Definition (HelloWorld):

     - Every Java program must have at least one class. In this case, it is HelloWorld.
     - The class name should start with an uppercase letter and match the filename (HelloWorld.java).
2. main Method:

     - This method serves as the entry point of a Java application.
     - public static void main(String[] args) is the standard signature for the main method.
     - public: The method is accessible to any other class.
     - static: The method belongs to the class and can be called without creating an object - of the class.
     - void: The method does not return any value.
     - String[] args: An array of String objects that stores command-line arguments.
3. System.out.println("Hello World"):

     - This statement outputs the string "Hello World" to the console.
     - System.out is a Java class that handles standard output.
     - println prints the argument and moves the cursor to a new line.
