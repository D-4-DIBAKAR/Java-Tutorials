## Key Points on Variables:
     1. Case Sensitivity: Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning age, Age, and AGE are all different variables.
     2. Valid Characters: Variable names can contain letters, digits, dollar signs ($), and underscores (_).
     3. Starting Characters: Variable names must start with a letter, $, or _. They cannot start with a number.
     4. Reserved Keywords: Java keywords (like int, public, etc.) cannot be used as variable names.
     Variable Types:
     5. int: For integers (whole numbers).
     double: For floating-point numbers (decimal values).
